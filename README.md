## Example

```php
<?php

use Amp\Http\Server\CallableResponder;
use Amp\Http\Server\Request;
use Amp\Http\Server\Response;
use Amp\Http\Status;

// Run this script, then visit http://localhost:1337/ in your browser.

Amp\Loop::run(function () {
    $server = new Amp\Http\Server\Server(new CallableResponder(function (Request $request) {
        return new Response(Status::OK, [
            "content-type" => "text/plain; charset=utf-8"
        ], "Hello, World!");
    }));

    $server->expose("*", 1337);

    yield $server->start();

    // Stop the server when SIGINT is received (this is technically optional, but it is best to call Server::stop()).
    Amp\Loop::onSignal(SIGINT, function (string $watcherId) use ($server) {
        Amp\Loop::cancel($watcherId);
        yield $server->stop();
    });
});
```
