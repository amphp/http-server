This package provides a non-blocking HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 application server written in PHP based on [Amp](https://github.com/amphp/amp).
Several features are provided in separate packages, such as the [WebSocket component](https://github.com/amphp/websocket-server).

The packages was previously named [`amphp/aerys`](https://github.com/amphp/aerys), but has been renamed to be easier to remember, as many people were having issues with the old name.

## Example

```php
<?php

use Amp\Http\Server\RequestHandler\CallableRequestHandler;
use Amp\Http\Server\HttpServer;
use Amp\Http\Server\Request;
use Amp\Http\Server\Response;
use Amp\Http\Status;
use Amp\Socket\Server;
use Psr\Log\NullLogger;

// Run this script, then visit http://localhost:1337/ in your browser.

Amp\Loop::run(function () {
    $sockets = [
        Server::listen("0.0.0.0:1337"),
        Server::listen("[::]:1337"),
    ];

    $server = new HttpServer($sockets, new CallableRequestHandler(function (Request $request) {
        return new Response(Status::OK, [
            "content-type" => "text/plain; charset=utf-8"
        ], "Hello, World!");
    }), new NullLogger);

    yield $server->start();

    // Stop the server gracefully when SIGINT is received.
    // This is technically optional, but it is best to call Server::stop().
    Amp\Loop::onSignal(SIGINT, function (string $watcherId) use ($server) {
        Amp\Loop::cancel($watcherId);
        yield $server->stop();
    });
});
```
